The only limitations with void pointers are:

1) you cannot dereference void pointer for obvious reasons
2) sizeof(void) is illegal
3) you cannot perform pointer arithmetics on void pointers

Advantages:
You should use it when you do not know what data type the memory
contains. The advantage is that once u know the data type, u may
typecast the void ptr into the appropriate data type.

A good example is the "malloc" function. It returns a void* and you can
typecast it to whatever type you need.

Prototype : void *malloc(size_t size);
Usage : int *n = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
